# Python Readme Maker

## Assignment
Create a tool using Python, to generate README markdown files for GitHub.

Python Libraries used:
- InquirerPy
- Rich

With examples from our class lessons, I was able to use these to form the basis of structuring the Python script. It asks the user a series of questions, collects the input from answers, and presents it in a visually appealing CLI using Rich.

I used this tool for the intro to welcome the user in the CLI.<br>

## Future iterations
I would consider breaking down the main.py file into separate modules in order to modularise the app, and make it easier to maintain and work with. At the moment, everything is all contained within one big main.py file.

There are also other functions available from InquirerPy that would allow more detailed user answers to be entered. At the moment, it's quite constrained and only works well with short, one line answers.
